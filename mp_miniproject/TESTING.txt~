Step1

(1)RUN ./ffosh. < ./tests/step1/step1test.txt
You will see that it prints:

ffosh$Makefile  README  TESTING.txt  TESTING.txt~  commandShell.txt  ffosh.  ffosh.cpp  numerics.txt	tests
Program was successful
ffosh$Program failed with code 2
ffosh$Terminated by signal 3
ffosh$

which is correct because when we redirect the contents in step1test.txt to cin, ffosh. will read the contents
from cin. The first program designated by step1test.txt is /bin/ls, which will print the documents in current
directory. The second program designated by step1test.txt will exit with exit(2) and the third will terminate
with raise(3). Consequently, the outputs are correct.

(2) Run ./ffosh. sarfaerfwqerqxc
    You will see that it prints:

Wrong number of command line arguments
 Usage: ./ffosh.
 
which is correct because we will only provide one command line argunmet, other inputs will be input from cin.
